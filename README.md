# Digital Energy Cell (DEC)

**Reinventing Grid Storage. Designed for Safety, Modularity, and Sustainability.**

The **Digital Energy Cell (DEC)** is a solid-state energy storage system engineered to challenge and outperform lithium-ion and sodium-ion technologies. DEC leverages a unique dielectric layering of **SiO₂ (Silicon Dioxide)** and **dielectric oils**, offering ultra-safe, modular, and scalable storage without thermal runaway risks.

## Features

- **Solid-State Capacitive Storage**  
  Uses SiO₂ and mineral/vegetable/fish oil dielectrics, avoiding volatile electrolytes.

- **Universal Smart Charger Compatibility**  
  Includes a smart charger profile (Model 3070) optimized for DEC, Li-ion, NiMH, and alkaline cells.

- **Modular Design**  
  Built for station-level storage but scalable to home use and electric vehicles.

- **Sustainability Focused**  
  Designed for low-toxicity, recyclable materials and long operational lifespan.

- **Advanced Thermal Protection**  
  Integrated anti-thermal runaway logic, emergency alerts, and auto-shutdown systems.

## How to Use

1. **Review `docs/DEC_Whitepaper.pdf`** for an overview of the concept.
2. **Check `design/charger_circuit.kicad`** for charger layout and connections.
3. **Run firmware in `code/firmware_control_logic.py`** on your test setup (Raspberry Pi or ESP).
4. **Explore materials in `/prototypes`** for building early-stage test cells.

## Vision

This project was born from a simple truth: **the system underestimates people with vision**. The DEC exists to prove them wrong—with real, open-source innovation.

---

## Licensing

All designs, code, and schematics are released under the **MIT License** for unrestricted use and adaptation.
